However, accurate, microscopic traffic simulations are time consuming (evaluating 10 minutes of traffic may take many seconds), while many optimization algorithms trying to find best settings require running large number of simulations. At the same time, we often don’t need information about the whole simulation process (as we can obtain from by running Traffic Simulation Framework), we only need information about a function measuring quality of given traffic signal settings.

This time, the approximations of traffic simulation outcomes turn out to be very good, giving the average relative error of approximations at the level of 1-2% and maximal error at the level 7%. In general, the approximations seems to be quite good, which can be also shown in the Figure 2 presenting distribution of a relative error of approximation on a (randomly selected) test se consisting of 14 634 elements).
