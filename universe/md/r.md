**R** is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) and [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) software environment for [statistical computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_computing) and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#cite_note-6) The R language is widely used among [statisticians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistician) and [data miners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) for developing [statistical software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_software)[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#cite_note-7) and [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis).[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#cite_note-8) Polls, [data mining surveys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexer%27s_Annual_Data_Miner_Survey) and studies of scholarly literature databases, show substantial increases in popularity in recent years.[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#cite_note-9) As of August 2018, R ranks 18th in the [TIOBE index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index), a measure of popularity of programming languages.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#cite_note-TIOBE-10)
