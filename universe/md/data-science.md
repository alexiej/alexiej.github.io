##  Data science

**Data science** is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) and insights from [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) in various forms, both structured and unstructured,[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-:0-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-2) similar to [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining).

Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-Hayashi-3) It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), [information science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science), and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science).

[Turing award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_award) winner [Jim Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gray_(computer_scientist)) imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science ([empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_research), [theoretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_research), computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the [data deluge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_explosion).[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-TansleyTolle2009-4)[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-BellHey2009-5)

In 2012, when [Harvard Business Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Business_Review) called it "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century",[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-Harvard-6) the term "data science" became a [buzzword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword). It is now often used interchangeably with earlier concepts like [business analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analytics),[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-GilPress-7)[business intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence), [predictive modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_modelling), and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics). Even the suggestion that data science is sexy was paraphrasing [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling), featured in a [2011 BBC documentary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wgq0l) with the quote, "Statistics is now the sexiest subject around."[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-8) [Nate Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver) referred to data science as a sexed up term for statistics.[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-NateSilver-9) In many cases, earlier approaches and solutions are now simply rebranded as "data science" to be more attractive, which can cause the term to become "dilute[d] beyond usefulness."[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-10) While many university programs now offer a data science degree, there exists no consensus on a definition or suitable curriculum contents.[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-GilPress-7) To its discredit, however, many data-science and [big-data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) projects fail to deliver useful results, often as a result of poor management and utilization of resources.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-11)[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-12)[[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-13)[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-14)
